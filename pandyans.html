<h1 align="center" id="top">Pandya Dynasty</h1>
<h2><span id="sp1">Origin</span></h2>
<img src="ins.jpg" id="img2"/>
<p>The Pandya Dynasty, also known as <b>the Pandyas of Madurai</b>, was a dynasty of south India, one of the three ethnically Tamil lineages.</p>
<p>The Pandyas ruled extensive territories, at times including the large portions of present-day south India and Sri Lanka (through collateral branches subject to Madurai).</p>
<p>The early Pandyan dynasty of the Sangam literature went into obscurity during the invasion of the Kalabhras. The dynasty revived under Kadungon in the early 6th century, pushed the Kalabhras out of the Tamil country and ruled from Madurai. They again went into decline with the rise of the Cholas in the 9th century and were in constant conflict with them. Pandyas allied themselves with the Sinhalese and the Cheras in harassing the Chola empire until they found an opportunity for reviving their fortunes during the late 13th century.</p>
<p>North Indian traditions such as the Great Epics and the Puranas often associate southern India with <b><em>Sage Agastya</em></b> (who crossed the Vidhyas and travelled south). Agastya appears prominently in medieval Tami literature also.</p>
<p>Folklores attributes <b>Alli Rani</b> (literally "the queen Alli") as one of the early historic rulers of the Pandyas. She is attributed as a <b>"amazonian queen" </b>whose servants were men and administrative officials and army were women. She is thought of ruling the whole western and northern coast of Sri Lanka from her capital Kudiramalai, where remains of what is thought of as her fort are found. She is sometimes seen as an incarnation of the Pandya associated gods, Meenakshi and Kannagi.</p>


<p >The earliest Pandya to be found in epigraph is Nedunjeliyan, figuring in the Tamil-Brahmi Mangulam inscription (near Madurai) assigned to 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. The record documents a gift of rock-cut beds, to a Jain ascetic. It is assumed that the people found in the Mangulam inscription, Nedunjeliyan, Kadalan, and Izhanchadikan predates rulers such as Talaiyanganam Nedunjelyan and Palyaga-salai Mudukudimi Peruvaludi.</p>
<h2><span id="sp1">Territory</span></h2>

<p>Pandya Nadu is an ancient region of South India. It includes the present-day districts of Tamil Nadu state, the districts are Madurai, Theni, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi, Kanniyakumari and parts of Dindigul district.</p>
<p>This region has been assosciated with the Pandya dynasty from at least 4th century BCE. The main cultural and political center of the region is Madurai, which served as the capital of the Pandya kingdom. It was involved in trade between western and eastern Asia via Indian Ocean, and had close cultural, economic, and political ties to Kerala and Sri Lanka.

Modern day capital for Pandya Nadu is Kanniyakumari, which is located at the tip of the India.

During 15th century, the region came under the control of the Vijayanagara Empire and after the collapse of the empire in the 16th century, the Nayaks of Madurai ruled the region until the British conquest in the 17th century. During 18th century, it was integrated into Madras Presidency. After Indian independence in 1947, Madras Presidency became Madras State, later renamed Tamil Nadu.</p>



<h2><span id="sp1">Golden age! </span></h2>
<p>The Pandyas (1216–1345) entered their "golden age" under Maravarman Sundara I and Jatavarman Sundara I ( c. 1251), who expanded the empire into the Telugu country (as far north as Nellore), south Kerala and conquered Sri Lanka.They also had extensive trade links with the Southeast Asian maritime empires of Srivijaya and their successors. During their history Pandyas were repeatedly in conflict with the Pallavas, Cholas, Hoysalas and finally the Muslim invaders from the Delhi Sultanate. The Pandyan Kingdom finally became extinct after the establishment of the Madurai Sultanate in the 16th century.</p>

<p>The Pandya kings were constantly at war with Pallavas, Cholas and Ceylon. In the eleventh and the twelfth centuries, the Pandyas were compelled to owe allegiance to the Cholas. It was in the thirteenth century that the Pandya kingdom acquired independence and became one of the important powers of the Deccan. In the same country, Marco Polo visited Pandya country twice: once in 1288 and again in 1292. In his account, Kayal, the capital of the Pandya Kingdom was a prosperous port and a beautiful city. With the fall of the Tamil power at the hands of Malik Kafur in 1310, the Pandya kingdom also came to an end.

<p style="float: right">The Later Pandyas (1150-1350) entered their golden age under Maravman Sundara and Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan, who expanded the empire into Telugu country, conquered Kalinga(Orrisa) and invaded and conquered Sri Lanka. They also had extensive trade links with Southeast Asian maritime empires of Srivijaya and their successors. During their history, the Pandyas were repeatedly in conflict with the Pallavas, Cholas, Hoysalas and finally the Muslim invaders from the Delhi Sultanate. The Pandyan Kingdom finally became extinct after the establishment of the madurai Sultnate in the 16th Century.

<p>The Pandyas excelled in both trade and literature before the Christian Era. They controlled the pearl fisheries among the South Indian coast, between Sri Lanka and India, which produced some of the finest pearls in the known ancient world.</p>
