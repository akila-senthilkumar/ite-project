<h1 align="center">The three legendary kings</h1>
<p>The Three Crowned rulers, or the Three Glorified by Heaven, or World of the Three, primarily known as Moovendhar, refers to the triumvirate of Chera, Chola and Pandya who dominated the politics of the ancient Tamil country, Tamilakam, from their three Nadu (countries) of <b>Chola Nadu</b>, <b>Pandya Nadu</b> (present day Madurai and Tirunelveli) and <b>Chera Nadu</b> (present day Karur in Tamil Nadu and Kerala) in southern India.</p><br>
<h2><span id="s1">Etymolgy</span></h2>
<p>The etymology of the Tamil word for the three kings – Moovendhar (pronounced Mūvēntar) – comes from Tamil: மூ, romanized: mū, lit. 'three' and Tamil: வேந்தர், romanized: vēntar, lit. 'king' so strictly should be translated as 'Lord' (lesser-king) as opposed to 'King' which in Tamil is <b>கோன் (Kōn)</b>.They are mentioned by Megasthenes and the Edicts of Ashoka,and first in Tolkappiyam among Tamil literature who was the first to call them Three Glorified by Heaven <em>(Tamil: வான்புகழ் மூவர், Vāṉpukaḻ Mūvar)</em>Ptolemy and the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mention three kingdoms ruling Tamilakam</p>
<br><p>Recent studies on ancient south Indian history suggest that the three major rulers – the Pandya, the Chera and the Chola – based originally in the interior Tamil Nadu, at Madurai, Karur (Karuvur)-Vanchi, and Uraiyur respectively, had established outlets on the Indian Ocean namely Korkai, Muchiri (Muziris), and Kaveri Poompattinam respectively.</p>
