<h2><span id="sp1">Cheras and South India</span></h2>
<img src="che.jpg" id="img1">
<p>Cheras/Keralas of the Kongu country are known to have controlled western Tamil Nadu and central Kerala in early medieval period.
The first to establish an historical ruling dynasty in the area, they ruled wide-ranging areas of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in south-eastern and south-western India respectively, areas that had been settled since at least 5000 BC, when Neolithic carvings had been left in Edakkal Caves. Chera territory included regions such as Venad, Kuttanad, Kudanad, Pazhinad, and others, encompassing the area between Kanya Kumari in the south to Kasargod in the north (now in the far north of Kerala). Also included in this list are Palghat, Coimbatore, Salem and Kollimalai, although they quite probably did not rule all of these areas at all times as ancient borders could be quite fluid at times. Their core territory was in Kerala, while the later rise of the Pallavas pushed them out of Tamil Nadu. However, they did establish a capital at Vanchi, which was known by the Romans as Muzris after an active sea-borne trade sprang up between the two powers.

<p>The lands south of the Mauryan Empire which included the Malabar coast, Karur, Coimbatore and Salem districts in South India were all part of the Chera Dynasty. The Chera capital was Tiruvanchikulam.</p>
<p>Utiyan Cheralatan was the first Chera king and is accredited with founding the dynasty. One of his battles was against the Cholas where he suffered a humiliating defeat as a result of which he committed suicide.</p>
<p>Utiyan’s son, Imayavaramban Nedun Cheralatan, through his grit and determination was responsible for making the Chera dynasty one of the most powerful kingdoms in the south. His rule lasted 58 years and during this time he won multiple battles and wars, the most famous of which was against his sworn enemies, the Kadambas of Banasvi.</p>
<p>Imayavaramban not only extended his kingdom, he also supported the local arts, culture and literature during his reign.

Yet, the greatest Chera king was to follow – King Kadalpirakottiya Vel Kelu Kuttuvan. The great Tamil epic, Silappadigaram ( which means the jeweled anklet) which tells the story about a mythical hero is supposed to be about him. There were two other epic works during that time which were Manimegalai and Sivagami Sindamani.</p>
<p>Kuttavan established the Patni (wife) cult which says that a wife must be completely devoted to her husband. An example of this is the story of the faithful wife Kannagi, who is remembered even today.

Kuttavan is also said to have achieved the famous victories at Mogur Mannan and Kongar.</p>
<p>The Chera kings used marriage to strengthen their ties with other clans as they were constantly warring with their neighbors and needed to strengthen their positions. With strong overseas links with places like Rome, the kingdom prospered immensely. The trade consisted mainly of spices, ivory and sandalwood. They also exported pearls and gems to the Middle East.</p>


<h2><span id="sp1">Fall of the empire</span></h2>
<p>All of the Chera kings stemmed from one of two clans, the Vanavaraman and the Irumporai, but there also seems to have been a level of intermarriage between the clans, making any attempt to construct a genealogy a complex affair. Stephen Barr has discovered that many lists (especially those online) are taken directly from one or two modern written sources - most especially the work by Professor Pillai. According to Pillai, the first Chera king on record was one Karuvur-Eriya-ol-val-ko-Perunceral Irumporai, who ruled at the end of the first century BC. Several sources give a list of nine rulers that extends backwards into the fifth century BC, but these are merely rehashes of existing names</p>
